Clone Patrol enhances web privacy through digital identity obfuscation. You choose a clone and then it auto-browses in the background.

## Background
Once you choose a clone, Clone Patrol launches and runs the clone in a dedicated browser tab. Each clone navigates through a curated list of websites specific to that unique profile. When advertisers and other tracking websites target you, this clone identity becomes mixed with your real identity.

## Features

  - Each clone has its own profile
  - Curated list of websites for each clone
  - Clones cycle through relevant websites
  - Clones don't click on links
  - Bandwidth metering feature in code
  - Lists continually checked for safety
  - Users can report problematic links
  - Code is open source for review
  - Clones can be run in minimized window
  - Clones can be run in a background tab
  - You can still browse while clone runs
  - Advertising networks will track the clone
  - Data aggregators will track the clone
  - Additional clones under development
  - No browsing data sent to Clone Patrol
